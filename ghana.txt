Ghana, located in West Africa, is known for its rich cultural heritage, vibrant history, and welcoming people. The countryâ€™s name comes from the ancient Ghana Empire, though modern-day Ghana is not located in the same area as the empire. It was the first African country to gain independence from colonial rule in 1957, with Kwame Nkrumah as its first president. Ghana is also famous for its colorful festivals, such as the Homowo Festival, celebrated by the Ga people to mark the end of the hunger season.
