I'd imagine that I received an email claiming to be from my bank, "SaveBank," with the subject line: "Urgent: Verify Your Account Now." The email urges me to click a link to update my account details due to a supposed security issue. It’s from "support@savebank-online.com," and there’s an attachment labeled "Account_Verification.pdf." Something feels off—the urgency, the slightly odd domain, and the unexpected file. I'd analyze it using free tools to confirm if it’s phishing.

Step 1: I'd inspect the Email Header as they contain metadata about the email’s origin and path, often revealing spoofing attempts common in phishing.
- Tool: MXToolbox Email Header Analyzer
- Process: I'd open my email client (e.g., Gmail, Outlook), I'd view the email’s raw source (in Gmail, I'd click the three-dot menu > "Show original"), and copy the header text. I'd paste it into MXToolbox’s analyzer at mxtoolbox.com/EmailHeaders.aspx.
- Findings: Spoofed domain (savebank-online.com vs. savebank.com), failed SPF, spam-linked IP.
- Verdict: Spoofing detected.

Step 2: Analyze Sender Domain
- Tool: WHOIS Lookup (via whois.domaintools.com)
- Process: I'd enter the sender domain, "savebank-online.com," into the WHOIS lookup tool to check its registration details.
- Findings: Registered 2 days ago, private ownership, vs. SaveBank’s long-standing domain.
- Verdict: Suspicious new domain.

Step 3: I'd Check the URL
- Tool: VirusTotal (virustotal.com), CheckPhish (checkphish.ai)
- Process: Scanned "http://savebank-online.com/login".
- Findings: VirusTotal flagged it as phishing (5/70 engines); CheckPhish noted typosquatting and fake login form.
- Verdict: Malicious link.

Step 4: I'd Examine Attachment
- Tool: VirusTotal
- Process: Scanned "Account_Verification.pdf".
- Findings: Embedded JavaScript, flagged as Trojan-Downloader, connects to shady server.
- Verdict: Malware-laden file.

Step 5: I'd Cross-Check Phishing Databases
- Tool: PhishTank (phishtank.com)
- Process: Searched "securebank-online.com".
- Findings: Matched a verified phishing campaign targeting SecureBank.
- Verdict: Part of known attack wave.
